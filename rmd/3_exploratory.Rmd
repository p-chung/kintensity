title: "3. Adding time to the daughter/grand-daughter equations"

The equations from the first couple of exploratory notebooks were stationary i.e. assume the mortality and fertility rates don't change over time. It would be nice to be able to make these a bit more realistic and add a time varying component to this. 

For the daughter and grand-daughter equations, this should be okay because we know how old the mother is (age $A$ at time $t$) so everything can be indexed based on that. 

Note that I'm not sure how to do this properly with the $l_x$'s, because these are still stationary measures based on period rates. So $l_x$ at time $t$ is going to over-estimate the probability of survival if mortality is declining over time. Time-indexing the fertility rates should be straight forward, though.
