abstract = {Close kin provide many important functions as adults age, affecting health, financial well-being, and happiness. Those without kin report higher rates of loneliness and experience elevated risks of chronic illness and nursing facility placement. Historical racial differences and recent shifts in core demographic rates suggest that white and black older adults in the United States may have unequal availability of close kin and that this gap in availability will widen in the coming decades. Whereas prior work explores the changing composition and size of the childless population or those without spouses, here we consider the kinless population of older adults with no living close family members and how this burden is changing for different race and sex groups. Using demographic microsimulation and the United States Census Bureau's recent national projections of core demographic rates by race, we examine two definitions of kinlessness: those without a partner or living children, and those without a partner, children, siblings, or parents. Our results suggest dramatic growth in the size of the kinless population as well as increasing racial disparities in percentages kinless. These conclusions are driven by declines in marriage and are robust to different assumptions about the future trajectory of divorce rates or growth in nonmarital partnerships. Our findings draw attention to the potential expansion of older adult loneliness, which is increasingly considered a threat to population health, and the unequal burden kinlessness may place on black Americans.},

abstract = {A longer life means that current cohorts can spend more years as members of a family in the statuses of parent, child, or spouse and in the combination of these statuses that defines the conjugal family. How much has this potential been realized? This question is addressed for the United States through a simulation of demographic conditions in 1800, 1900, 1960, and 1980. Despite declining fertility and higher divorce rates, women in the 1960 and 1980 cohorts spent more years in marriage and as parents than did earlier generations. They also spent more years as children of aged parents. But much of the potential offered by longer life spans has not been achieved. Not only did the number of years in marriage and parental statuses decline between 1960 and 1980, but current cohorts spend a smaller proportion of their adult lives in them. On the basis of these results, we propose some scenarios of the ways that potential increases in the amount of time that people spend in family statuses may provoke social change.},

@article{Heer1968,
abstract = {Although the worldwide population explosion has been created by a decline in death rates, paradoxically a further decline in mortality in the less developed nations may be an invaluable aid for curbing the current rate of world population growth. This paper presents the results of several computer-simulation models in which it is presumed that parents have a perfect method of birth control but also want to be highly certain that at least one son will survive to the father's sixty-fifth birthday, so that he can support his parents in their old age. Under these assumptions, the results of the computer simulations show that the rate of population increase will be greatest when the level of mortality is of intermediate magnitude. This intermediate level of mortality is the level which now obtains in most of the less developed nations. When the mortality level is very high, couples are biologically incapable of bearing as many children as they would like. Hence, on the one hand, a high mortality level results in only slightly higher fertility than do intermediate levels of mortality, and, consequently, the rate of population growth is somewhat lower at a high level of mortality than at intermediate levels. On the other hand, when mortality is low, as in the developed nations, the desired number of births drops precipitously, and the rate of population increase is very low. In the less developed nations, reductions in desired family size may be obtained either through programs to reduce infant and child mortality or through social security programs that may serve to reduce parental desire to be highly certain of at least one living son during old age. However, it is doubtful that a perfect means of birth control will of itself achieve a low rate of world population growth. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Chung2018,
abstract = {This study employs microsimulation techniques to provide an accounting of exposure to imprisoned or formerly imprisoned kin. We characterize the risk and prevalence of imprisonment within full kinship networks and find that the life course trajectories of familial imprisonment experienced by black and white Americans take on qualitatively distinct forms: the average black American born at the height of the prison boom experienced the imprisonment of a relative for the first time at age 7 and by age 65 belongs to a family in which more than 1 in 7 working-age relatives have ever been imprisoned. By contrast, the average white American who experiences the imprisonment of a relative does not do so until age 39 and by age 65 belongs to a family in which 1 in 20 working-age relatives have ever been imprisoned. Future reductions in imprisonment rates have the potential to meaningfully reduce these racial disparities in family imprisonment burden. T WO bodies of research have been particularly important in tracing the full reach of the carceral state into the American family during the era of mass impris-onment. The first uses formal demographic methods to document variations, by cohort, race, and education, in the cumulative risk of own and paternal impris-onment (Bonczar 2003; Bonczar and Beck 1997; Pettit and Western 2004; Western and Wildeman 2009; Wildeman 2009). The second explores the " connectedness " of prisoners to friends, family, and local communities (Clear 2007; Lee et al. 2015; Rose and Clear 2004; Wildeman and Turney 2014). Taken together, these bodies of research offer substantial insight into how individuals and families have been touched—directly or indirectly—by the rise in imprisonment rates since the early 1970s. One element that is missing from these literatures, however, is an analysis of how the prison boom has affected extended family networks and the exposure to imprisonment within such networks. Demographic research provides estimates of an individual's risk of own or paternal imprisonment but not similar estimates detailing, for example, cousin's or uncle's imprisonment or—more importantly—the overall number of family members likely to ever be imprisoned. The connectedness literature, by contrast, does in some cases extend beyond the nuclear family, but as is discussed below, data limitations curtail analyses of change over time and of connectedness to previously incarcerated individuals. In this study, we combine the methodological innovation of the demographic work on cumulative imprisonment risk with the research imperative of the connect-edness literature. Building on life table approaches, we employ a microsimulation technique to infer lifetime trajectories of imprisonment from cross-sectional counts and rates. 1 This allows us to account for changes in the magnitude of imprisonment risk over historical time and in the distribution of that risk over ages and across 335 Chung and Hepburn Imprisonment in Kin Networks races. Simply applied to individuals or parent–child dyads, these simulations would tell us little that previous demographic research has not. Indeed, we exploit this overlap: we replicate previous research findings as a check on the plausibility of the assumptions that underlie our models (see Appendix A3 of the online supplement). Our major contribution is to go one step further and to estimate imprisonment risks within entire kinship networks for multiple cohorts of black and white Americans. Our findings indicate that the risk of imprisonment within extended kin net-works has fallen earlier and more heavily upon black Americans than on white Americans: the average black American born at the height of the prison boom experienced the imprisonment of a relative for the first time at age 7 and by age 65 is expected to belong to a family in which more than 1 in 7 working-age relatives have ever been imprisoned. By contrast, the average white American who experiences the imprisonment of a relative does not do so until age 39 and by age 65 is expected to belong to a family in which 1 in 20 working-age relatives have ever been impris-oned. Parents, partners, and children—the relations typically studied in research on the collateral consequences of imprisonment—constitute less than half of the overall exposure to imprisonment within kinship networks. We leverage the capacity of simulations to look toward the future, evaluating the potential effects of several proposed decarceration goals. We find that national reductions in imprisonment rates could eventually lead to a meaningful narrowing of the race gap in kin im-prisonment, but these reductions—even if implemented immediately—would not dramatically change the lifetime prevalence of kin imprisonment for those families whose members have already lived through the prison boom.},

The transnational families of many immigrants also displayed this separation, as families extended across borders. In addition, demographers demonstrated during the decade that trends such as marriage and divorce were diverging according to education. Moreover, demographic trends in the age structure of the population showed that a large increase in the elderly population will occur in the 2010s. Overall, demographic trends produced an increased complexity of family life and a more ambiguous and fluid set of categories than demographers are accustomed to measuring.},

abstract = {Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing, are rapid in today's wealthier countries, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.},
