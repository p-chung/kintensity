@article{Goldman1978,
abstract = {Based on stable population theory, a mathematical relationship is developed between the intrinsic rate of increase (r) of a population and the ratio (2) of the average number of younger sisters ever born to the average number of older sisters ever born, for a random sample of women in the population. This mathematical formula is then converted into a technique for estimating r from data on numbers of sisters. The extent to which the technique may be generalizable to actual populations is discussed.},

The role of mortality as an independent variable producing change in parent-child bonds, orphanhood, divorce and fertility rates, the number of dependent elderly persons, and widowhood is analyzed.},

@article{Cherlin2010,
abstract = {Demographic trends in the 2000s showed the continuing separation of family and household due to factors such as childbearing among single parents, the dissolution of cohabiting unions, divorce, repartnering, and remarriage. The transnational families of many immigrants also displayed this separation, as families extended across borders. In addition, demographers demonstrated during the decade that trends such as marriage and divorce were diverging according to education. Moreover, demographic trends in the age structure of the population showed that a large increase in the elderly population will occur in the 2010s. Overall, demographic trends produced an increased complexity of family life and a more ambiguous and fluid set of categories than demographers are accustomed to measuring.},

abstract = {A longer life means that current cohorts can spend more years as members of a family in the statuses of parent, child, or spouse and in the combination of these statuses that defines the conjugal family. How much has this potential been realized? This question is addressed for the United States through a simulation of demographic conditions in 1800, 1900, 1960, and 1980. Despite declining fertility and higher divorce rates, women in the 1960 and 1980 cohorts spent more years in marriage and as parents than did earlier generations. They also spent more years as children of aged parents. But much of the potential offered by longer life spans has not been achieved. Not only did the number of years in marriage and parental statuses decline between 1960 and 1980, but current cohorts spend a smaller proportion of their adult lives in them. On the basis of these results, we propose some scenarios of the ways that potential increases in the amount of time that people spend in family statuses may provoke social change.},
