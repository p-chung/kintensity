# The Quantum and Tempo of Kinship
## (with [Monica Alexander](https://github.com/MJAlexander))

This project is an elaboration of formal demographic methods to estimate the density and timing of kinship transitions using readily available national data. This work develops a set of easily-calculable lifetable equations that return reasonable estimates of total family size (not to be confused with parity) implied by different demographic rate regimes.
