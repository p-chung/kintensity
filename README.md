# Kin Dependency Ratios: An Extension and Application of the Goodman Method for Estimating the Availability of Kin

(_with [Monica Alexander](https://github.com/MJAlexander)_)

This project is an elaboration of formal demographic methods first introduced by Goodman and Colleagues (1974) to estimate the availability of kin using readily available national data. This work develops a set of easily-calculable lifetable equations that return reasonable estimates of total family size (not to be confused with parity) implied by different demographic rate regimes. We demonstrate a practical application of this technique: the derivation of a _kin dependency ratio_ (KDR)---a measure of expected kin support burden---which we compare to the _total age dependency ratio_ (TADR), a commonly-reported measure of public support burden in aging populations.
